# Interpolation
## Description
Realization of three interpolation methods: Lagrange, Newtone, and spline intrerpolation. Also provides a basic simple user interface to produce polinom and graphic.  By default interpolation is done on function, which is specified in Interpolation.cpp:func(). To perform interpolation from table, its required to fill Array** int Interpolation.cpp.
## Interface
Fill the text box in the left-top part of form with: 
  [PointsnNumber] [MethodNumber]
PointsNumber - amount of interpolation points, which will be generated depends of function provided in code. 
MethodNumber - 1 - 3, where 1:Lagrange, 2:Newtone, 3:spline - interpolation method, which will be used.
